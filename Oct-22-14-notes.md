Document Object Model &ndash; "DOM"

Evented language &ndash; "Nothing ever happens until something happens"


| Objects                | Events |

| have properties        |
| have methods/functions |


HTML is the document object.

There is also the window object:
```JavaScript
window.innerHeight;
```

`onLoad` bad.  `ready` good. &ndash; [api.jquery.com/ready](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)

"`$`" gets aliased to the jquery object

```JavaScript
$(document).ready(handler);
```

after document is ready, go after "no-js" class

```
$('html')
```

Equivilent to `CSS` selecting `html` elements.

Anyway, then you can manipulate the object you've found.
