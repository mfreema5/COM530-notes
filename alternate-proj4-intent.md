#Alternative project 4

Instead of the multi-page (or multi-page-like) web presence specified for project 4, I will create multiple webpages as the deliverable “artifact” for my thesis research this semester.

##Project expectations and requirements

* Design
  * Employ mobile-first, responsive design techniques
  * Design to a typographic scale
  * Design to a basic grid system
* Source-code
  * Valid, well-formed HTML5 and CSS
  * Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original
  * HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements
  * The same, lone CSS file for all site pages
* Function
  * Thoughtful use of media-queries with breakpoints specified in em units
  * JavaScript that does not throw any errors, if project uses JavaScript
  * CSS3 transitions that enhance user experience, where appropriate

##Pages in thesis site

* *Abstract & Table of contents*
  * Separating this out aids in the mobile-first design
    * Smaller page should load faster
    * Abstract will inform the user whether they want to bother with the rest of the site
    * Table of contents will link to sections within pages, so the user doesn't have to scroll through the page
* *Thesis: Including practical impact in the measure of research quality*
  * This page will use available HTML5 elements such as &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; to organize information on the page
* *Practical impact levels: discussion and examples*
  * On this page, the document design will (hopefully):
    * Indicating relationships between items
    * Help the user easily find the most important information
    * Make the information easier to understand and remember
* *References*
  * Separating out the references avoids duplication of information on pages
* Possible pages:
  * *Current citation metrics: details and comparisons*
  * *Future research: more speculation*
