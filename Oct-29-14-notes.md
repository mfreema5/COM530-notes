##Mobile-first design

Block-elements default to 100% width (of containing block).  So, making anchor (`<a>`) element "`display: block`", you get a clickable area that's the width of the containing block.

Ideal: when you cross media-query width, the length of lines shouldn't visibly change, but just stop expanding.

Use min-width only.  In "em" units.

##Using fonts from Google

"`@fonts`"



Copy "css" link from google-font webpage
* Loads CSS file, but isn't responsive.
* "Web-font loader"
 * Lets us track if fonts get loaded or not, etc. (see below)





##[Web-font loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader)

### Events

>Web Font Loader provides an event system that developers can hook into. It gives you notifications of the font loading sequence in both CSS and JavaScript.

  * `loading` - This event is triggered when all fonts have been requested.
  * `active` - This event is triggered when the fonts have rendered.
  * `inactive` - This event is triggered when the browser does not support linked fonts *or* if none of the fonts could be loaded.
  * `fontloading` - This event is triggered once for each font that's loaded.
  * `fontactive` - This event is triggered once for each font that renders.
  * `fontinactive` - This event is triggered if the font can't be loaded.

>CSS events are implemented as classes on the `html` element. The following classes are set on the `html` element:

```css
.wf-loading
.wf-active
.wf-inactive
.wf-<familyname>-<fvd>-loading
.wf-<familyname>-<fvd>-active
.wf-<familyname>-<fvd>-inactive
```

etcetcetc&ellipsis;

##Progressive enhancement

* Being aware of what happens when various things fail
 * Fail to load fonts, etc.



Is it just in your post that you have:  "&#x96; &#x2d;encrypted" (the first two characters as html-hex: "&amp;#x96;&amp;#x2d;")?  As opposed to "&#x2d;&#x2d;encrypted" ("&amp;#x2d;&amp;#x2d;")
