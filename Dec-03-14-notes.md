##Following along with Karl

"Create a new blog".

"Customize" ([www.tumblr.com/customize/mjf-tawp](https://www.tumblr.com/customize/mjf-tawp?redirect_to=/blog/mjf-tawp))

"Edit HTML"

Wipe HTML.

Write in HAML; output to HTML; copy into Tumblr.

"Use default mobile theme" &ndash; on by default; turn it off.

RSS feeds
* `rel:"alternate",type:"application:rss+xml",href:"{RSS}"`
* Add link to RSS feed in &lt;footer&gt;

"Basic variables"

"Blocks"

"Permalink tag"

link to an external CSS
* `rel:"stylesheet",href:"http://example.com/styles.css"`

(A "gh-pages" branch is treated as a website by Github &ndash; so *that's* why people have been doing that!)
(So, you can create a `screen.css` in a "gh-pages" branch and pull it into an external resource.)
