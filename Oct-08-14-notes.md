#Laws of Simplicity

1. Reduced
2. Organize
3. Time


##Reduce

**SHE**

  * Shrink
  * Hide
  * Embody

How are these applied to the single-page web presence project?

#### Shrink
  * Design for mobile first
  * Have a specific, limited audience in mind

#### Hide
  * Hide the content that's not for the size of display being used
  * Hide source code
  * Hide the complexity, show the essential

#### Embody
  * "Embue this [page] with some kind of value"
  * Employ specific design choices
  * "Looks like you were thinking of exactly their screen!"
  * "You have to make other people care."
  * Value in having a nice URL.
  * "Source available on GitHub."


##Organize

*"Oragnizations makes a system of many appear to be fewer."*

**SLIP**

* Sort
* Label
* Integrate
* Prioritize

####Sort
  * Focus
  * Next
  * Base

####Integrate
