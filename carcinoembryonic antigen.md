##Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) ([http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/carcinoembryonic-antigen-cea](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/carcinoembryonic-antigen-cea))

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein, which is present in normal mucosal cells but increased amounts are associated with adenocarcinoma, especially colorectal cancer.


###Conditions which may have elevated CEA
* Colorectal cancer
  * tumours on the right side of the colon tend to produce higher CEA levels than tumours on the left side.
* Non-malignant liver disease, including cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis
* Inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome
* Respiratory diseases, e.g. pleural inflammation, pneumonia
* Smoking
* Ageing

* Used for monitoring colorectal cancer and selected other cancers such as medullary thyroid carcinoma.
* Interfering substances: Haemolysis (the disintegration of red blood cells)

##Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in a patient treated with capecitabine. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967725](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967725))

###Abstract

A 61-year-old female, followed-up for a metastatic breast cancer, was admitted in our institutionâ€¦ In this clinical case, capecitabine is the most likely factor causing an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

##Haemolytic Anaemia ([http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/haemolytic-anaemia](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/haemolytic-anaemia))

###Symptoms

* Symptoms are due to both anaemia and the underlying disorder. Patients with minimal or long-standing haemolytic anaemia can be asymptomatic.
* Severe anaemia, especially of sudden onset, may cause:
  * tachycardia (rapid heart rate, especially one above 100 beats per minute)
  * dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing or in catching the breath)
  * angina (spasmodic attack of suffocating pain)
  * weakness
