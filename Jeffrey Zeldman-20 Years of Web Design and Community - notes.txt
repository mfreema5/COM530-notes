Stop trying to imitate print

“Spotting the narratives”

(Evolving metaphors for the Web?)

+++++

“Communication designer” - learned that from advertising

“There are all of these gatekeepers, when you're a creative person.”
  But not with the web.

“An exciting presentation medium.”
  (Layers of metaphors.  It's just pixels on a screen!  But they become shapes become objects become mental constructs that have meaning and convey information, and we someone interact with them to cause changes in the physical world.  But it's ALL JUST PIXELS!

“Like you're in a submarine” creating something with your collaborators.

(Aside:
  Web browsers are weird.  They're like a Nintendo.  By themselves they do *nothing*.  But you load pages and there's the fun.  Music players and video players are imitating physical devices.  A web browser is like a VM, and a web page is like an OS you install on it.  But it's not contained.

“A List Apart” - was originally a mailing list, became a web magazine.

“First article I wrote was heavily editted, like reviewed through three processes… which gave it an authority….”  (And the gatekeepers are back!)


(Info filters are personal/individual gatekeepers.)

“‘Share what you know’ was the motto of the web.”


“We design for people.”
  (But what people?  See XKCD.)

“The web is supposed to be a platform for sharing all human knowledge.”
  (What sorts of knowledge aren't supported?)


(Aside:
  “Search” functions destroy organization and linking, because they make it unnecessary.  Why is that bad?  Because without organization and linking you can explore and discover.  It occurs to me that perhaps that's one of the reasons Wikipedia is so popular—the ability to follow links around and discover new things.  The whole web was supposed to be like that!  That's why it was called a WEB!)
